<p>My second project was bigger and more difficult! After being well versed in object-oriented programming I took it to the next level and made a simple alien invaders game.</p>

<p>I used the module pygame and several of its elements to make the game and the most time-consuming part of the project was realising how to make the ship and the aliens move.</p>
