I"«<p>Hi there! Iâ€™m Maisha - an aspiring data scientist &amp; software engineer, currently studying Math at the University of Waterloo! Amongst other things, I also enjoy design &amp; illustrating :) Currently - Iâ€™m really interested in machine learning and itâ€™s uses in the medical industry and would love to experience that given the oppurtunity. If Iâ€™m not coding then youâ€™ll usually see me drawing in my tablet!</p>
