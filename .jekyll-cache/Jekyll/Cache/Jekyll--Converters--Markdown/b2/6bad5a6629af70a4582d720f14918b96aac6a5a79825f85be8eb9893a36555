<p>My first project to get started on python was a to-do list. It‚Äôs fully command line based and doesn‚Äôt have a GUI.</p>

<p>It got me started with the basics of python and object-oriented programming.</p>

<p>The challenging part of this project was getting used to classes and objects. it was difficult realising which attributes of a task should be initialized,but after this project my object oriented programming skills are stronger now !</p>
