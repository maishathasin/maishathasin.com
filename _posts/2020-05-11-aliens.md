# Project 2: ALIEN INVASION ðŸ‘½

My second project was bigger and more difficult! After being well versed in object-oriented programming I took it to the next level and made a simple alien invaders game.

I used the module pygame and several of its elements to make the game and the most time-consuming part of the project was realising how to make the ship and the aliens move.
