# Command Line (CLI) based TODO Application ☑️

My first project to get started on python was a to-do list. It's fully command line based and doesn't have a GUI.

It got me started with the basics of python and object-oriented programming.

The challenging part of this project was getting used to classes and objects. it was difficult realising which attributes of a task should be initialized,but after this project my object oriented programming skills are stronger now !
